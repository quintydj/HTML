    <h1>World's Best Honey Garlic Pork Chops</h1>
    <img src="../img/pork.jpg" alt="Pork dish" />
    <h4>
      When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will
      love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop
      recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular
      honey-garlic glaze â€” but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk
      too.
    </h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2/3 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a
        glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush
        glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer
        pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
        degrees C).
