    <h1>Honey-Garlic Chicken Thighs</h1>

    <h4>
      This is one of my family's favorite recipes. It's garlic-sweet and the
      cilantro tops it off.
    </h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 (5 ounce) boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>7 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup honey</li>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the bottom of a cast iron skillet with olive oil and bring to
        medium-high heat. Add chicken and brown on one side, 3 to 5 minutes.
        Flip chicken, and add onion and garlic; continue to cook until chicken
        is mostly (but not fully) cooked and onion and garlic are soft, 5 to 7
        minutes more. Remove chicken to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add honey, soy sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and onion powder to
        the skillet. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon
        to get the garlic and onion to mix with the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put chicken back into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium. Cook
        until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 more
        minutes, turning once halfway through. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center of a thigh should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place on a serving tray and drizzle liquid from the pan on top. Sprinkle
        with chopped cilantro before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
